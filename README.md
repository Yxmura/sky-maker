1. Go to [releases on this repository](https://github.com/Yxmura/sky-maker/releases/tag/release) and download the latest exe file
2. Use [Cubethesphere](https://cubethesphere.software.informer.com/1.0/) to map your image to 6 bmp files
3. While not changing the image file names, this is important for the program to recognize the correct files, run the exe and a website should be opened in your default browser
4. Upload the six images and hit the convert button
5. You'll see the image transition won't be smooth. You'll need to do this manually, you can use the patch tool in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com) or [this method](https://youtu.be/_5QU1cXuSnE?si=oA11DMXordou9MHM&t=247)
